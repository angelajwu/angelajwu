                <des> The objective of this project was to design, construct and build a structure to help Mario and Luigi cross a 12 foot lava pit. The structure could only be attached to 4 concrete columns, at least 2 feet from the lava. On test day, teams had 20 minutes to erect their structure, ensuring no part of it touches the lava. Teams were given $200 and approximately 6 weeks to complete the project.

                <br>
                In addition to plan and elevation views of the structure (above), detailed CAD drawings of the attachments and bracings were also produced.
                <br><br>
                Almost 40 pages of supporting calculations were done using MathCAD to ensure the structure would bear the load of Mario or Luigi (assumed to be approximately 180 lbs).

                I created the poster design for our team's final presentation. The design incorporates our created structure (a rainbow bridge) into a themed poster that is nostalgic of the 8-bit Super Mario Odyssey.

                Our final structure cost $172.36, weighed 76.9 lbs, and was constructed in less than 11 minutes.
