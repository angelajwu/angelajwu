                <des> Booth is a Carnegie Mellon tradition for its annual Spring Carnival. Organizations build themed temporary structures in the span of one week during a period called "Build Week". As overall chair of Alpha Phi's Booth, I oversaw the development of all CAD designs, the interior design of the rooms, exterior design of the structure, and a VR game. I developed schedules for all elements, and made sure all prefabricated pieces were completed prior to Build Week. I managed an overall budget of over $5000, ultimately running $1500 under budget.

                In addition to overseeing the entire project, I was in charge of the design and creation of the second floor - entirely Powerpuff Girls themed. I drew all initial designs using Adobe Photoshop, and led a team of 15 people in painting the walls and building figures to fill the rooms. The first staircase, featuring the intro of the Powerpuff Girls show, was also supplemented by audio.

                Shown below are samples from construction drawings. The original set of construction drawings were created by Emily Melillo, and were edited and reviewed by me to ensure pieces would be supported and meet structural standards established by the Spring Carnival Committee.

                <br>
                Each wall was sheathed using 1/8" plywood. I created a tracker of plywood pieces and sizes our organization had from previous years and used this information to create a sheathing layout that used as many recycled pieces as possible.

                <br>
                I reviewed the original construction drawings to ensure the building would be safe, finding the second floor platforms created by our construction chair were initially floating in mid-air and not resting on walls from the first floor. I edited the drawings and frame dimensions so that at least 2 opposite sides were supported by frames from below.
                <br><br>
                I created schedules for each room within the structure (total of 3 rooms & exterior) spanning from January to April 2017 using MS Project.

                I also managed the budget for the entire project. The project went under budget at around $4000, with an initial budget of $5500.
